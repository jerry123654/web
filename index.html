Doraemon received critical acclaim and became a hit in many Asian countries. It won numerous awards, including the Japan Cartoonists Association Award in 1973 and 1994,
 the Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982, and the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 1997. As of 2012, it has sold over 170 million copies worldwide, becoming the
 sixth best-selling manga in history. Doraemon is also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, of which the animated film series has the highest number of admissions in Japan.
 The Doraemon character has been viewed as a Japanese cultural icon, and was appointed as the first "anime ambassador" in 2008 by the country's Foreign Ministry.

<p><font color="pink"font size="10">Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel, "The House of Paper") is a Spanish heist crime drama
 television series created by Álex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor
 (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the
 perspective of one of the robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The narrative is told in a real-time-like 
fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an unreliable narrator
 for complexity.</font></p>
